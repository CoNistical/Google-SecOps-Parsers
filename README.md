# Google-SecOps-Parsers
Custom parsers for Google SecOps

## Description
A collection of custom parser extensions that I created for logs coming into Google SecOps.
These parser work for my instance - so you may need to adjust as needed but hopefully they can give you a starting point depending on how your logs are formatted.

### Layout
All of the parsers are in text format - I normally write these in VSCode and then upload them into the SecOps platform.
